# Suggesting-Best-Courses-using-Sentiment-Analysis

**This project placed us 4th in Ingenious Hackathon'22 organized by ISA-VIT, Pune**

**-> We aimed to analyze courses on the basis of their comments and not just the stars the get.**

**-> You just have to enter the URL of the course you want to analyze.**

**-> By web scraping, we get the comments on that course and send it to our ML model (Count vectorizer followed by Random Forest).**

**-> The model classifies each comment into positive, negative and neutral.**

**-> After applying some maths, we display a rating of that course purely on the basis of the comments it has.**

**-> The model is trained on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/course-reviews-on-coursera**

**Here is performance of the model -**
